/**
 * 
 * Request container for the findCompletedItems call.
 * <br><br>
 * You can expect response times for this call to be longer than other types of Finding Service
 * requests. The call must search through historical databases rather than performing a quick
 * lookup on currently listed items. There is a 5,000 limit on the number of findCompletedItems
 * calls an application can make in a single day (even if the application has completed an
 * app check).
 * <br><br>
 * Be aware that it is possible to use this call in such a way as to violate the terms and
 * conditions of your API License Agreement. Ensure that you do not store the results retrieved
 * from this call or use the results for market research purposes.
